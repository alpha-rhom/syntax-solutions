# Syntax Solutions

Syntax Solutions is a web application meant to find syntax examples easier and quicker to find. The four developers who built the application all attended an intense, full time coding bootcamp in San Diego, CA, LEARN Academy. During our time at LEARN, we found ourselves searching the web for basic syntax examples within the languages we were learning. We quickly realized how much time this was taking and decided to develop a solution to make the searching easier and quicker.

Syntax Solutions allows users to create their own coding snippets. As a registered user, you can view all the snippets, search them, and even sort them. So, if you're learning JavaScript and you need a quick syntax example of how to write a map function, you can find that in seconds on Syntax Solutions by searching for it.

Some additonal features include liking/dislikng snippets, updating/deleting your own snippets, commenting, and even tipping the creator of the snippet if it really helped you out.
